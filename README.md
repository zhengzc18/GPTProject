## Mind-level AGI Project for mental & behavioral science

This application is created to improve health, science, and AI research for all. 

This application is created to improve health, science, and AI research for all. The main purpose of research is focused on the future of AGI (artificial general intelligence) system that is linked to the ability to do any kind of cognitive tasks. This means that we believe the development of AGI-powered AI assistant is closely associated with cognitive psychology and behavioral science, and their combined research approach and strategies can play a central role in creating conceptual cognitive frameworks that are related to social relationships and behaviors. Oneâ€™s cognitive schema can affect individual perceptions like visual effects because this consists of autobiographical memories that are combined two kinds of memories: episodic & semantic memories. Enhance, this GPT-based app is using the function of art generator and text generation so that it could help people find the meaning of both consciousness and unconsciousness. And we believe that these efforts can contribute to current clinical decision-making, such as mental health care for workers.
